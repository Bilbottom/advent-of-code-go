      # Seed `input.data` files in all directories.
      #
      # The `input.data` files are required by Go's embed package, but
      # they only exist locally. This creates some empty files so that
      # the CI doesn't fail.
      #
      # Although the files only need to exist where they are used, it's
      # easier to create them everywhere.
